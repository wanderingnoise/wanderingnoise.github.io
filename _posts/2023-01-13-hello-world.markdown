description: The first hearing of a lonely signal

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello World.</p>

<br/>

Is there anybody out there? 

I'm the lonely signal behind this blog. Can you hear me? <br/>
Of course not, sometimes signals are difficult to be recognized.

I'm writing you these few words because this space will be my personal memo thru the immersive AI journey I'm starting. <br/>
Here I will post about the studies I will carry out, and share with you the results.

My idea is to start with the AI fundamentals first, then to focus on AI applied to cybersecurity.

I'm starting this journey from scratch -- well, honestly I have a compsci background: I'm just curious and excited about this path and I would like to explore this universe, committing myself thru the blog.

About commitment: I will share the results of my researches (at least) twice per year, on June and December. <br/>
Results will be shown on the <a href="https://wanderingnoise.com/docs">dedicated page</a>, and further information could be found on the <a href="https://github.com/wanderingnoise/">GitHub repositories</a> of the project.

English is not my mothertongue (which language should be for a signal?), I bet this will improve over time.
